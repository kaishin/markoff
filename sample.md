# Chapter 1
## Loomings

Call me Ishmael. Some years ago- never mind how long precisely- having little or no money in my purse, and nothing particular to interest me on shore, I thought I would sail about a little and see the watery part of the world. It is a way I have of driving off the spleen and regulating the circulation.

2nd paragraph. *Italic*, **bold**, and `monospace`. Itemized lists
look like:

  * This one
  * That one
  * The other one

Note that --- not considering the asterisk --- the actual text
content starts at 4-columns in.

> Block quotes are written like so.
> They can span multiple paragraphs, if you like.

Use 3 dashes for an em-dash. Use 2 dashes for ranges (ex., "it's all
in chapters 12--14"). Three dots ... will be converted to an ellipsis.
Unicode is supported. ☺

### Lists

Here's a numbered list:

  1. First item
  2. Second item
  3. Third item

As you probably guessed, indented 4 spaces. By the way, instead of
indenting the block, you can use delimited blocks, if you like:

~~~python
import time
# Quick, count to ten!
for i in range(10):
    # (but not *too* quick)
    time.sleep(0.5)
    print i
~~~

Now a nested list:

1. First, get these ingredients:
  * Carrots
  * Celery
  * Lentils

2. Boil some water.

doc](#an-h2-header).
